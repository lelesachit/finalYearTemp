However, the performance of mid and small-cap stocks was subdued, with the Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Small Cap 250 recording losses of 0.24% and 0.19%, respectively.Among sectoral indices, Nifty FMCG, Nifty IT, and Nifty Oil & Gas emerged as top performers, posting gains of 3.6%, 3.5%, and 2.6% respectively. The robust performance of these sectors can be attributed to several factors including strong earnings reports and favorable market conditions. Conversely, Nifty Metal, Nifty PSU Bank, and Nifty Realty faced challenges, ending the week with losses of 2.63%, 2.09%, and 2.32%, respectively.
